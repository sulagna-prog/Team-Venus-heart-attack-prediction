# Team-Venus-heart-attack-prediction

NAME OF YOUR PROJECT:	HEART ATTACK CHANCES PREDICTOR

TRACKS: HEALTHCARE

IDEA:
Our idea is to create a Machine Learning model using Logistic Regression that trains itself based on a provided dataset and predicts the chances of heart attack for a particular person. The information in the dataset includes basic fields like age, gender, BMI, blood pressure and other biological factors of a person. Based on these past records and symptoms collected via a survey from various people and sources, our trained model predicts if a person has chances of a heart attack with maximum accuracy possible. 

GOALS:
•	Help the medical field in developing modern AI based systems to cure diseases.
•	Alert the person beforehand about risks and chances of heart attack in the future.
•	Use past records and symptoms to generalize the conditions for a particular disease.
•	Analyze a person’s heart condition regularly using ML.

Files:
1.framingham.csv: The dataset used

2.heart_prediction.pynb: Jupyter noteboom to show data vizualization, to train and test the model along with customized input.

ANYTHING ELSE:	
The entire model shall be based on a python framework and using Logistic Regression with the training dataset created on the basis of symptoms and data provided by a large number of people.
